# Recipe_Box

This was the first group project assignment for the bootcamp, to utilize the languages and libraries we learned over the first seven weeks.  The requirements were as follows:

~Must use at least two APIs.

~Must use AJAX to pull data.

~Must utilize at least one new library or technology that we haven't discussed.

~Must have a polished frontend/UI.

~Must meet good quality coding standards (indentation, scoping, naming).

~Must NOT use alerts, confirms, or prompts.

~Must have some sort of repeating element (table, columns, etc.).

~Must use Bootstrap or alternative CSS Framework.

~Must be deployed (Github Pages).

~Must have user input validation.

And the stretch goals were:

~Utilize Firebase for persistent data storage (consider this basically a requirement).

~Mobile responsive.

~Use an alternative CSS framework like Materialize.


--Opportunities for improvement:  

   -We didn't complete the user input validation requirement, which would be necessary for this to be a usable site.
   
   -Other APIs would provide more targeted results, but we were limited by not choosing any that required payment.
   
 --Key takeaways:
 
    -CORS hack was invaluable.
    
    -Everything is defined by the API results.  Choose them carefully and scope accordingly.
